  "summary": "Implements a multi-section marketing site with header navigation, martial-arts themed styling, a contact form wired to backend APIs, and an Internet Identity-based admin gate. However, backend persistence via stable storage is not evidenced, required generated image assets are not evidenced as added, and several unrequested backend/user-profile/access-control features appear introduced.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend stores inquiries in stable storage so they persist across reloads.",
      "reason": "The backend stores submissions in an in-memory `let submissions = List.empty<ContactSubmission>()` with no `stable var` or `preupgrade/postupgrade` persistence logic shown, so persistence across canister upgrades/reloads is not evidenced.",
